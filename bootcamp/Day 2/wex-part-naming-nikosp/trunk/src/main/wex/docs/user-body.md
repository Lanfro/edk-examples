## FAKE User Guide

The objective of this extension is to allow for the export of published representations of objects quickly and easily.  The export can be executed for a single or a collection of representables through the User Interface, triggered by an event or using a workflow robot. In addition the export is available from the search results.
The results of the export will either be saved to a folder on the server or presented as a direct download to the user. A single XML meta data file will also be generated for each exported object which includes attributes of the representation and its representable. The behaviour of the export can be  configured by the administrator through the use of configurable options. 
The plus version also includes features to save the export as a document and send it as an email to a list of predefined users.

See the standard  [extension](https://windchill-extensions.ptc.com/kb/articles/rep-export-user-documentation) documentation for the standard guide.

If the extension has been configured to send an E-mail to the Users when the export is complete, a document 
will be created with the result of the export as primary content and be sent to the list of users that was specified in the configuration.

The UI controls in the tool bar allow you to add related cads to the table or children of the selected part.
