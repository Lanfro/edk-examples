## FAKE Overview

Representation Export Plus extends Windchillâ€™s Core PDM module by making it faster and easier for users to export published representations. This offers significant productivity gains. The extension also eliminates human error in missed representations, as well as missed exports on desired workflow triggers like promotions or changes. Windchill users may interactively export for a single representable or multi-selection of representables (including from a search result). The extension may also automate exports triggered by an event or using a workflow robot.

The results of the export may be saved in a specified folder on the server or presented as a direct download to the user. The export also generates an XML metadata file for each exported object with the attributes of its representation and representable. The Windchill administrator may configure the export behavior.
Additionally to the features offered by Representation Export, this extension allows to export a set of representations as documents that can be stored back in Windchill, offering a full traceability and sending them as emails to lists of predefined users.

Representation Export Plus is often used with Promotion Validate and/or Watermarking to automate rule-validated and stamped packages.
